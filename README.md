# SAMP-Peds

Adds Peds in all SA using FCNPC.
Peds will roam the streets and react to different events, eg. gunshots, dead players/NPCs, vehicles and rival Peds/Players.
Peds of certain groups will behave accordingly, Cops hunt criminals, whores will enter the vehicles of players, gangs fight each other and hang around in groups, etc.

The Ped Node Net is made from scratch and much more detailed and complete than the original one.
It consists of different types of Nodes, eg regular Nodes, Road Cross Nodes, Flee Nodes (for fleeing Peds), Hiker Trails and attractors.
Different towns are connected where possible. Attractors can be (fake) Interior Enter/Exits, Benches/places to sit, Slot Machines in Casinos
and auto-generated locations for various animations (leaning against a wall, laying on the beach or swimming in a pool).

Custom attractors and functions to disable certain areas are available.

The Editor can be implemented into the script as well, allowing for ingame Node Editing/customizing
the Node Net for custom maps and the server.
